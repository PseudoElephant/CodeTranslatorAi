## Folder Usage

This folder is used to group all files related to the same feature.

### Example Usage

```
/modules
        /auth
            /api
                AuthAPI.js
                AuthAPI.test.js
            /components
                AuthForm.tsx
                AuthForm.test.ts
            auth.js
```

Above is an example of store our authentication code in the folder. As you can see instead of splitting the "auth" code everywhere, it is now centralized into a single folder.
